<!--Welcome to YouthTech, an event listing and coding resource website for young people in Ireland. 
This website was designed, created, coded and is updated by me - Jack Delaney, age 13 from County Down. I have used my own theme 'Castle Street' which I coded from scratch myself (but not mit scratch!)! I have used WordPress as a CMS to ensure my code is elegant and easy to update with better SEO control.
To make this site I have used HTML-PHP Fusion, Pure PHP, CSS and JavaScript.
I've added loads of comments throughout the code so anyone making their own site would be able to understand the process.-->
